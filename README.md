# Java Pawn Race
Small "AI", started as a coursework for a first year coursework for the Java course, at Imperial College London. I won 4th place in my year with it, by "deafeating" other AIs created by other students.

The game is really simple and interacting with it is even simpler, since you have to use the command line. Move the desired pawn by typing the letter and the number of the destination square. The objective is to reach the other side of the board before your oponent!
